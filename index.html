        <P>The Ultimate Guide to Making Authentic Italian Lasagna at Home
            the
            epitome of comfort food. Originating from the Emilia-Romagna region of Italy, this dish has evolved into
            a
            global favorite, but nothing beats the satisfaction of crafting it from scratch.. Whether you’re hosting
            a
            family dinner or treating yourself to a cozy night in, this recipe yields a bubbling, golden lasagna
            that
            serves 6-8 people. Prep time: 45 minutes | Cook time: 1 hour | Total time: 1 hour 45 minutes.
            Ingredients
            For the Meat Sauce (Ragù):
            1 lb (450g) ground beef (or a mix of beef and pork for authenticity)
            1 onion, finely chopped
            2 garlic cloves, minced
            1 carrot, finely diced
            1 celery stalk, finely diced
            1 can (28 oz) crushed tomatoes
            2 tbsp tomato paste
            1 cup red wine (optional, but recommended for depth)
            2 tbsp olive oil
            Salt, pepper, and a pinch of nutmeg to taste
            Fresh basil leaves (for garnish)
            For the Béchamel Sauce:
            4 tbsp unsalted butter
            4 tbsp all-purpose flour
            4 cups whole milk, warmed
            Salt and white pepper to taste
            A dash of nutmeg
            For Assembly:
            12-15 lasagna noodles (no-boil or fresh; cook if using dried)
            2 cups ricotta cheese
            2 cups shredded mozzarella
            1 cup grated Parmesan
            Fresh parsley, chopped (optional)
            Step-by-Step Instructions
            1. Prepare the Meat Sauce: Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the onion, carrot, and
            celery
            (the classic soffritto) and sauté until softened, about 5 minutes.. Stir in the garlic and cook for 1
            minute
            more. Add the ground meat, breaking it up with a spoon, and brown for 8-10 minutes. Pour in the red wine
            (if
            using) and let it reduce by half. Stir in the tomato paste, crushed tomatoes, salt, pepper, and nutmeg.
            Simmer on low for 30-45 minutes, stirring occasionally, until thickened. Taste and adjust seasoning.
            2. Make the Béchamel: In a saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Whisk in the flour and cook for 2
            minutes to form a roux (it should be smooth and bubbling lightly). Gradually pour in the warm milk,
            whisking
            constantly to avoid lumps. Cook until the sauce thickens (about 5-7 minutes), then season with salt,
            white
            pepper, and nutmeg. Set aside.
            3. Assemble the Lasagna: Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Spread a thin layer of meat sauce on the
            bottom
            of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Add a layer of lasagna noodles, then a scoop of ricotta, followed by meat
            sauce,
            béchamel, mozzarella, and Parmesan. Repeat the layers (noodles, ricotta, sauces, cheeses) until you run
            out
            of ingredients, ending with a generous topping of cheeses. Cover with foil.
            4. Bake: Place in the oven for 30 minutes covered, then remove the foil and bake for another 15-20
            minutes
            until the top is bubbly and golden. Let it rest for 10-15 minutes before slicing—this helps the layers
            set.
            Pro Tips for Lasagna Perfection
            Make Ahead: Assemble the lasagna up to 24 hours in advance and refrigerate. Add 10-15 minutes to the
            bake
            time if starting cold.
            Vegetarian Twist: Swap the meat for mushrooms, spinach, and zucchini for a lighter version.
            Cheese Hack: For extra creaminess, mix the ricotta with an egg and some chopped parsley before layering.
            Pairing: Serve with a crisp green salad and garlic bread. A glass of Chianti complements the flavors
            beautifully.

            Now we are going to show you how making homemade pasta is really easy, what are the tricks to keep it from
            drying out, which is the best way to roll out the pasta dough and much more!

            Jump to:
            Ingredients
            Prep Time: 1 Hour | Servings: 4

            200 g (1 ⅓ cups) of “00” soft wheat flour
            200 g (1 ⅓ cups) of durum wheat flour (semolina flour)
            4 eggs of at least 70 g (2,5 oz) each. Fresh homemade pasta usually wants 1 egg x 100 g (¾ cup) of flour
            Kitchen Tools and Equipment
            You can choose to knead by hand (as in this recipe) to make fresh Italian homemade pasta, or you can use a
            stand mixer (we recommend kitchenaid stand mixer). This way you save time and effort, as a good fresh pasta
            must be processed for a long time and with a lot of energy.
            For a good result of fresh pasta you need to use the spiral dough hook. Ideal for pasta, pizza and other
            heavy dough. It is commonly used in first and second speed.
            We opted for the Imperia pasta maker machine to roll fresh pasta, maybe the most famous pasta maker machine
            in Italy. This kitchen tool is equipped with both a wood grip handle, to roll out the dough manually, and a
            two speed motor attachment.
            If you have opted for the kitchenaid stand mixer, you can use the pasta maker attachment for kitchenaid: 3
            in 1 set that includes pasta sheet roller, tagliolini cutter and tagliatelle cutter.

            Instructions
            The Pasta Dough (by Hand)
            To make this recipe we used a flour mixture made with 50% flour "00" and 50% durum wheat flour that we find
            perfect both for the dough and for the cooking. That said, let's show you how to make Italian homemade pasta
            by hand.

            homemade pasta step 1
            Step 1) - Place the flours on a work surface and create a hole with your hands. For those who are making
            homemade pasta for the first time we recommend using a bowl because the job will be easier. Split the eggs
            and put them in a bowl then pour the eggs into the hole.

            homemade pasta step 2
            Step 2) - With the help of your fingers, mix the eggs with the flours, incorporating a little at a time,
            until everything is combined. Knead the pieces of dough together. At this point, if you are using the bowl,
            remove the dough and place it on the table or try this non-slip mat that sticks to the table for kneading
            dough.

            Now you have to knead and work it with your hands for about 10 minutes. Pay attention: if the dough is too
            soft and sticky, add flour; if it is too hard and with too much flour yet, add water. This is the hardest
            work but it's necessary. If you don't knead the flours with the eggs very well, the dough will be soft when
            cooked and not al dente as it should be.

            homemade pasta step 3
            Step 3) - After ten minutes, make a big ball and wrap it in a cling film. Let it rest at room temperature
            for 15/30 minutes. The cling film is usefull not to dry out the dough and let it go crusty around the edges
            while rolling it.

            The Pasta Dough (with Stand Mixer)
            You can choose to knead by hand as in the steps above or you can use a stand mixer (we recommend kitchenaid
            stand mixer). In this way you save time and effort, as homemade pasta must be kneaded for a long time and
            with a lot of energy. For a good result of fresh pasta you need to use the spiral dough hook that is perfect
            for kneading pasta dough. It is commonly used in first and second speed.

            fresh fettuccine pasta recipe step 2
            So pour the flour into the bowl of your stand mixer and start mixing with the spiral dough hook at speed 1.
            Add the eggs, one at a time, and continue to mix for 5-6 minutes until the mixture is smooth, but not
            compact. Now increase the speed to 2 and knead for another 5-6 minutes, until you get a ball.

            Turn off the machine, take the ball and knead it by hand for 1 minute. Put it back in the bowl of the mixer
            and knead it again for 2 minutes at speed 1. Now take the ball and wrap it in cling film, then let it rest
            for at least 15/30 minutes.

            Roll Out the Pasta Dough with a Pasta Maker
            homemade pasta step 4
            Step 4) - First make sure that your pasta maker machine is clamped firmly to a clean surface. We opted for
            the Imperia pasta maker machine to roll fresh pasta dough, maybe the most famous pasta maker machine in
            Italy. This kitchen tool is equipped with both a wood grip handle, to roll out the dough manually, and a two
            speed motor attachment.

            That said, dust your work surface with some flour, using THE DURUM WHEAT FLOUR, that's important. Take a
            lump of pasta dough the size of a tennis ball and press it out flat with the palms of your hands. Keep the
            rest of the dough wrapped in cling film to keep it soft.

            homemade pasta step 5
            Step 5) - Roll the lump of pasta dough through the widest setting of your pasta machine or pasta roller
            attachment. Remember to dust the pasta dough with durum wheat flour if you feel it's becoming sticky.

            homemade pasta step 6
            Step 6) - Fold the pasta dough in half and then again in half.

            homemade pasta step 7
            Step 7) -Then (again) roll the lump of pasta dough through the widest setting of the pasta machine. Repeat
            the process for 3 or 4 times (roll-fold-roll). You have to work the dough till it's smoother.

            Roll Out the Pasta Dough by Hand
            Take a piece of dough and with your hands make a ball, the size of a tennis ball. Flatten it with your hands
            to give it a disc shape. Then roll out the dough on the work surface, always well floured with the DURUM
            WHEAT FLOUR, with the help of a rolling pin. Start always from the center, sliding it in all directions in
            order to obtain a pasta sheet of uniform thickness. Keep to roll out the dough until it reaches a thickness
            of about 1 millimeter.

            For a classic pasta such as tagliatelle, tagliolini and pappardelle, roll up the pasta sheet starting from
            the flap facing down, without pressing.
            Then, with a long and sharp knife, cut the pasta into strips of 1-2 millimeters for the tagliolini, about 1
            cm for tagliatelle and 1-3 cm for pappardelle.
